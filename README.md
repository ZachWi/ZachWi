I'm Zach Willis or @ZachWi.
My page has a main focus on electrical engineering and fun C/python scripts.

As a child, I was not really exposed to the world of CS or even electrical engineering for that matter, but always a fascination for electronics and circuitry. Later in youth, I figured out how much of a passion that was when I started religiously studying the NES archetecture, and became enammered, which definitely helped bring me where I am today. I'll be focusing on attaining a bachelors in electrical engineering, and possibly a minor in CS.

Thank you for your time, it is always appreciated.
If any questions arise, email me at Constellationagram@gmail.com.
Have fun!
